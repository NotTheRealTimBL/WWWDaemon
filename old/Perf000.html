<H1>Performance of FIND server 29 May 91</H1>Conditions: Loops over   XFIND COPY TAPE CMS with SHOW DATE.  Normally
loaded machines (around 14:00) running VMS and accessing CRNVMC with
HTTP/TCP/IP.
<XMP>			Loops/min	Loops/sec
One process on one machine at a time:
	VXCRNA		27		.45 Hz
	ONLINE		27		.45 Hz

One process on each machine, all at the same time:
	VXCRNA		25		.4 Hz
	ONLINE		20
	VSOC28		18
	VSOC06		16
	Total		79		1.3 Hz

Thee spawned processes each machine, all the same time (12 in all):	
	VXCRNA		49		.4 Hz

	ONLINE		21

	VSOC28		20

	VSOC06		19

	Total		109		1.8 Hz

</XMP>The last test apparently brought the VM TCP interface close to running
out of buffers and losing telnet connections. This is with a version
of the daemon which incorrectly gives precedence to incoming new connections
over messages on existing connections, and so the number of connections
at any one time may have been larger than necessary. The test demonstrates
that the server (if not the IBM) behaves well under overload. The
throughput figure is sufficient for our <A NAME=11 HREF=../Talks/FIND_problems.html>estimates</A> of peak load on
a running system.</A>
